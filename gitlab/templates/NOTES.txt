The initial infrastructure components have been deployed.
In case you are running into issues, please verify if the following components are working correctly:

- Constellation Azure Disk CSI driver
- cert-manager
- external-dns
- NGINX Ingress Controller

In case the DNS entries for the Ingress points are not created correctly, make sure you provided the correct secrets.

Hurray, GitLab on Constellation has been deployed!
It may take 5-10 minutes for all components to be set up completely.

Afterwards, you can access your GitLab instance here:
https://gitlab.{{ .Values.gitlab.global.hosts.domain }}/

To log in, use "root" as the username.
You can retrieve the initial password with the following command:
    kubectl get secret {{ .Release.Name }}-gitlab-initial-root-password -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d

Have fun!
